I created a responsive TodoList project using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to keep a list of tasks to be done. When a todo is added, it goes to the todoList area, and a message "todo added" appears on the screen. If we click the add todo button without writing anything, we get a notification saying "at least one todo must be present to add a todo." The added todos can be deleted one by one or by pressing the "clear all todos" button. To delete them one by one, we click the cross icon next to each todo, and it gets removed from the screen, also giving us a notification saying "todo deleted." When we click the "clear all todos" button, all added todos are removed from the screen, and a notification says "all todos cleared." After adding many todos, if we can't find the desired todo, we use the filter area. By using JavaScript's handy "includes()" method, the todo filtered by the user appears on the screen with display property set to block, while the display property of non-matching todos is set to none. This way, only matching todos appear on the screen.![Ekran görüntüsü 2024-07-08 200146](https://github.com/IlhanBal57/TodoList/assets/167097961/bde001e1-fd40-4a55-b2f8-52cfa2d2a918)
